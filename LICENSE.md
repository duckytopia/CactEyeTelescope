RE-DISTRIBUTION OF THIS PACK IN ITS ENTIRETY
I retain all distrubtion rights with one exception: if the download link(s) I have provided are unavailable, you may TEMPORARILY re-host the content on another site as long as you give clear, proper credit and do not claim ownership of the pack.

This pack is NOT to be included a larger mod pack.


RE-USE OF ASSETS INCLUDED
If you'd like to use some of my assets (defined as everything under the "Parts" folder -- models, textures, and part CFGs), please send me an email with specific details on how it'll be used. If I do not reply, you still do not have permission to use the asset(s).

The probeCoreSlim part is an exception to this clause, as it was specifically designed to resemble parts included with the game. You are free to re-use/re-distribute the probeCoreSlim part however you want, as long as you give clear, proper credit and do not claim ownership of the part.


RE-USE OF PLUGINS INCLUDED

CactEyeTelescope.dll and KASRescaleFix.dll
You are freely available to redistribute and modify the source code of these plugin files, under some certain conditions.
- You must give clear credit to me and this pack. Do not claim ownership of the plugin(s).
- Acknowledge the version used (which is at the top of this document).
- If you have not modified the plugin, keep the plugins in the same folder structure included with the pack ("GameData/CactEye/Plugins") to avoid having multiple copies of the same plugin file.
- If you have modified the plugin, rename it to avoid confusion and technical conflicts with this pack.
- For KASResizeFix.dll, you should probably clarify that the plugin has no affiliation with KAS, and is intended merely as a bugfix for KAS.

CET_FSanimateGeneric.dll
This plugin file uses code from the Firespitter pack. It has been recompiled into a separate dll to both avoid conflicts with the Firespitter pack, and to add a few lines of code necessary for the ladder part.
You are NOT free to redistribute this plugin. The unmodified Firespitter plugin IS available to use, see the forum thread here:
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551

Source code of all plugin files is available at
